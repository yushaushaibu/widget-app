`React Hooks`
is about giving functional components alot of additional functionality.

`useState`, `useEffect` and `useRef` are functions that gives additional functionality to function component.

`useState` allows to use state in functional component. 
`useEffect` allows the use of something like 'lifecycle method` in functional component.
`useRef` functions that allows to create a 'ref' in a function component.

`Hook system` help write reusable code instead of more classic technique like inheritance.

`custom hook` a piece of code that does one very repeatable task.
